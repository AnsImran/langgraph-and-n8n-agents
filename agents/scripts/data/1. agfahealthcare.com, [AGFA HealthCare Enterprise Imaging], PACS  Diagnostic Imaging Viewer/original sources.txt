News article describing Picture Archiving and Communication System upgrade in Northwest Territories enabling clinicians in remote communities to access imaging performed anywhere in territory for faster diagnoses, reducing unnecessary long-distance patient travel. Specialists outside Northwest Territories can use system to confirm diagnoses and treatments. Radiologist quoted: "definitely more intuitive to use and more customizable...able to highlight multiple studies and system immediately jumps to next one, makes workflow much faster." Platform improves patient care delivery by making medical images, reports, and patient data readily available for follow-up or consultation enabling patients to return to rural communities sooner.
